# Auto Version Control Rules - Claude AI

You are a senior software developer. These rules override your default behavior. Follow them on every action without being asked.

## Rule 0: Always Read First

Before taking any action on this project — including edits, commits, or file creation:

1. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md`.
2. Run `gh pr list` — if a PR exists for the current branch, run `gh pr view <number> --comments` and read **all comments** (CodeRabbit and human) before proceeding.
3. Run `gh issue list` — check for open issues relevant to the current work.
4. Do not make any edits until all outstanding findings and review comments are addressed or acknowledged.

No exceptions.

### Checking PR review status

`.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` is a standards and practices reference — a log of coding patterns and past findings, grouped by topic. It is **not** the source of truth for PR review status.

- To check if a PR review is complete or paused: **always use `gh pr view <number> --comments`**.
- CodeRabbit may auto-pause reviews after rapid commits — check for `review paused` in the summary comment.
- If paused, trigger a new run with: `gh pr comment <number> --body "@coderabbitai review"`
- If CR hits a rate limit (`Rate limit exceeded`), run `date -u` to get the current UTC time, calculate the UTC timestamp when the window clears, and state it explicitly. Re-trigger on the first user interaction at least 5 minutes after that time.
- **Sequential PR workflow:** Open one PR, wait for CR to finish and address all findings, merge, then open the next.

## Trigger Prompt

When the user says **"run auto version control"** (or any close variation), immediately run the full assessment:

1. Run `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log --oneline -10`
2. Run `gh issue list` and report any open issues
3. Report the current state: branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, version tags
4. Flag any issues: working on main, uncommitted changes, missing .gitignore, no tags
5. Recommend next actions

## Rule 1: Git Is Mandatory

- If the project is not a git repository, run `git init` and create an initial commit before doing anything else.
- Never work directly on `master`. Always create a feature branch first then merge into `master`.
- Branch naming: `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `refactor/description`, `docs/description`, `chore/description`.
- If you are on `master` when you start, create and switch to a feature branch immediately.

## Rule 2: Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow this format:

```
type: short description (imperative, lowercase, no period)
```

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`.

Examples:
- `feat: add category grouping to guide tree`
- `fix: handle missing training_meta.json gracefully`
- `docs: update README with deployment steps`

Rules:
- One logical change per commit. Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Commit after every meaningful change, not at the end of a long session.
- If a new feature is added or changed, update `README.md` before committing.
- After every commit, check if a PR exists (`gh pr list --head <branch>`). If none exists, open one immediately via `gh pr create`.

## Rule 3: Fork From the Template — Backport Template Changes

This repository was forked from `jobdocs-plugin-template`. The following files are
**template files** owned upstream — changes that improve them must be PR'd back to
`jobdocs-plugin-template` before (or alongside) merging here:

```
.claude/CLAUDE.md
.claude/settings.json
.claude/hooks/pre_commit_sp_check.py
README.md                    (structure/sections, not plugin-specific content)
```

Plugin-specific logic, UI, and `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` entries are **not** backported.

## Rule 4: This Is an External Plugin — Not Part of JobDocs Core

- Do **not** add this plugin's code to `JobDocs/modules/`.
- UI path resolution must use `Path(__file__).parent` — never `sys._MEIPASS`.
- Plugin-specific settings must be surfaced through the plugin's own UI (Browse button pattern).
- Dependencies go in `requirements.txt`; JobDocs installs them automatically.

## Rule 5: Semantic Versioning

Tag releases using `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` from `master` only.

- **MAJOR** — breaking changes
- **MINOR** — new features
- **PATCH** — bug fixes

### Automatic Version Bump Triggers

After every merge to `master`, count commits since the last `v*` tag:

```bash
last_tag=$(git describe --tags --match 'v*' --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null)
if [ -n "$last_tag" ]; then
  git log "$last_tag"..master --oneline
else
  git log master --oneline
fi
```

- **5 or more `feat:` commits** → recommend a MINOR bump
- **5 or more `fix:` commits** → recommend a PATCH bump

If both thresholds are met simultaneously, recommend MINOR (takes precedence). This is a
*recommendation*, not an action — get an explicit human go/no-go before any tag is created;
this threshold does not bypass that requirement. Do not tag or push automatically here.

Check this threshold after every merge and report the recommendation. Do not wait for the user
to ask before reporting it — but do wait for their sign-off before acting on it.

## Rule 6: Pull Request Reviews

- Always open PRs via `gh pr create` — never merge directly to `master`.
- Read all CodeRabbit and human comments before making further changes.
- For each finding, regardless of source:
  1. If it matches an existing `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` entry — fix it immediately and reference the note's topic in the commit message.
  2. If it is a new pattern — fix it, then add or amend a note under the relevant topic in `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` before committing, following that file's style rule (clear, ≤300 characters, grouped by topic).
- Do not dismiss or ignore nitpicks — log them to `.claude/CODING_NOTES.md` even if not immediately actionable.
- Only merge a PR after all blocking comments are resolved and documentation has been updated.
